# Bib-to-Html-Convertor

Testing
--------
This app has only been tested (to date) with 1 bib file, included in the test-bib-files/ directory. I will be running more tests with other bib files and I'll add these to the repository over time. Feel free to include your own and if you encounter any issues with your own bib files please report this.

Feedback
--------
Please give feedback on the app. I want to constantly improve accessibility and functionality in this app. This can either be suggestions on things to add, bugs to fix or write some changes to the code which improve the app!

Motivation
----------
The idea for this app came from me trying to find a dedicated .bib to .html convertor and only finding programs which dealt with specific .bib files and not a general case. I needed to make a website for one of my university modules and a bibliography had to be included. I didn't really want to write out the entirety of the references in my html files but I was constrained for time so I had to do it that way. I hope that this simple app allows someone else in the same position as I was to easily transfer the contents of their bib files into html code. Maybe I'm just lazy but I thought it would be useful and a fun project to work on.

I'm not a computer science student, I study Theoretical Physics but have a keen interest in software development and programming.

Python Version
--------------
This app was coded in Python 3.6.2.
